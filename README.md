## Description
-  My motivation was to create a backend for a e-commercial retail site to track inventory, price and many other things.
-  I built this application to support the front end of an e-commerce site with a working backend.
-  This solves the problem of storing data for inventory management.
-  I learned how to create working route and manipulate data in tables inside Sequelize.
